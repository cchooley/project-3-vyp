Galvanize Tower
In this project, you'll build a full-stack application that has an API, reads and writes data, and uses a library. The topic is up to you!

Consumes your API (list, read, update, create, and delete actions)
Uses some non-trivial (charting, mapping, payment, etc.) library
Has at least 2 end-to-end tests
